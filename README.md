### Hi there 👋

You have landed on my page it seems. My interests are 
all over the place but you will see some
commonality in my love for low-level coding, graphics,
emulation, and DevOps type work. Finding clean, reproducible, processes
that make it easier for groups of people to iterate on code and
innovate gets me pretty excited.

Currently working on cross-platform provisioning scripts
built with Docker, Ansible, and many other tried and true tools.

Will add more details soon. 😅❤️
